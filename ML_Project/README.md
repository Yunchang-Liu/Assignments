# Australian Rain Data

## Context
This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia. Predict next-day rain by training classification models on the target
variable RainTomorrow.

## Problem Statement
RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It means -- did it rain the next day, Yes or No?

## DataSet
[weatherAUS.csv](https://github.com/Yunchang-Liu/Assignments/blob/main/ML_Project/weatherAUS.csv)

## Steps
1. Import the Dataset
2. Divide into training set and test set before Data cleaning
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model and Predict
5. Ensembles
6. Test models against the test dataset.
